### How has COVID impacted Real Estate markets in U.S Metro Area?

COVID-19 has impacted our lives in more ways than we can imagine - Offices are closed and people are forced to work from home. As a result, we believe that there has been a shift in peopleâ€™s priorities when it comes to buying a home. Our Analysis was focused on the U.S Metro Area, and more specifically Boston, New York, and San Francisco. We found that overall, prices in downtown areas have been more heavily impacted than the suburbs. In some cases, we can see prices move in opposite directions when comparing Downtown Areas to the outskirts of the city.
